# Scripting

x Make separate zones for upgrades to avoid always having cards processed
  - i.e. when you pull a card into your Draw deck
  - Additional notes:
    x Cards that are flipped upside down, even when in upgrade zones, should not count as an upgrade
    x May need to check if card is within an upgrade zone when flipped face up and process accordingly

x Take account of removing upgrades from zones

x Check for upgrades already in zones when scripting is loaded

- Captain Special Abilities need to be coded and accounted for when on the snap points

x Check which crew are still on the original snap points and update upkeep accordingly
  x Show upkeep in UI

x Crew not on original snap points, but on Captain card need to count for Defense
x Crew on ship needs to count for Defense

x Counters & buttons to change amount for resources
  x Trading calculator

--Bonus:
  - Use better colors for resources
  - Detect damage cubes and crew members on Ship(s) in the middle and show a UI of the current status
  - Button on unowned ship "Claim Ship" which replaces your ship
